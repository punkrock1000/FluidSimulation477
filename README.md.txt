/**********************************How to compile the code**********************************/
To compile and run the program, you need Microsft Visual Studio.
Simply click on the Visual Studio solution FluiDimulation477.sln to open the solution of the program.
Then, since the program is computationally heavy, we strongly recommend running in release mode, which is done by pressing Ctrl + F5.

To reset the simulation, press 'R'.
