/**********************************How to compile the code**********************************/
Requirements: you need Microsoft Visual Studio. We cannot guarantee versions prior to 2010 work. (It has to be at least compatible with Open GL 2.1.)
Simply click on the Visual Studio solution FluidSimulation477.sln to open the solution of the program.
Then, since the program is computationally heavy, we strongly recommend running in release mode, which is done by pressing Ctrl + F5.


To reset the simulation, press 'R'.
